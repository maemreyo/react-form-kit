# InputHelperText Component Design Specification

## Overview

The InputHelperText component is designed to provide additional context, guidance, or information to users regarding an input field. It is commonly used to display hints, instructions, or validation messages that assist users in filling out forms correctly. This component is highly customizable, supports accessibility, responsiveness, and integrates with various design systems.

## Features

1. **Helper Text Display**:
   - Displays text below or alongside an input field to provide additional context or instructions.

4. **Positioning**:
   - Allows helper text to be positioned below, above, or beside the input field.

5. **Icon Support**:
   - Optionally displays an icon alongside the helper text for visual emphasis.

6. **Dynamic Content**:
   - Supports dynamic content updates based on input field state (e.g., validation).

7. **Localization**:
   - Supports internationalization by accepting translated strings.

8. **Security**:
   - Sanitizes helper text content to prevent XSS attacks.

9. **Performance**:
   - Optimized for minimal re-renders using memoization techniques.

10. **Interactivity**:
    - Allows helper text to include clickable links or buttons for additional actions.
