# FormGrid Component Design Specification

## Overview

The `FormGrid` component is a flexible and responsive grid system designed to organize form elements into a structured layout. It supports responsive breakpoints, gap control, column sizing, alignment options, nesting, and more. The component is highly customizable, accessible, and optimized for performance, making it suitable for building complex forms with a consistent user experience.

## Features

1. **Responsive Breakpoints**:
   - Adjusts the grid layout based on screen width using media queries.
   - Supports custom breakpoints and column configurations.

2. **Gap Control**:
   - Defines consistent spacing between grid items using CSS variables.

3. **Column Sizing**:
   - Allows flexible column sizing (e.g., `1fr`, `2fr`, fixed widths).

4. **Alignment Options**:
   - Supports vertical and horizontal alignment of grid items.

5. **Nesting Support**:
   - Allows nesting of `FormGrid` components for complex layouts.

6. **Order Control**:
   - Manages the order of grid items using the CSS `order` property.

7. **Equal Height Rows**:
   - Ensures grid items in the same row have equal height.

8. **Auto-layout Options**:
   - Supports auto-flow direction (e.g., row, column).

9. **Accessibility**:
   - Complies with ARIA standards for screen readers and keyboard navigation.

10. **Performance Optimization**:
    - Uses memoization to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
    - Optimized for rendering large grids with many items.

11. **Customization**:
    - Supports custom styling and theming via CSS-in-JS or CSS variables.
