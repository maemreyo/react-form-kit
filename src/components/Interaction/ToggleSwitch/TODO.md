# ToggleSwitch Component Design Specification

## Overview

The ToggleSwitch component is a versatile UI element that allows users to toggle between two states, typically "on" and "off." It is commonly used in settings, forms, and interactive interfaces to enable or disable features or options. This component is designed to be highly customizable, accessible, and performant, making it suitable for a wide range of applications and design systems.
