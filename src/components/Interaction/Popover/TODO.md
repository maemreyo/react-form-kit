# Popover Component Design Specification

## Overview

The `Popover` component is a floating UI element that displays contextual content or actions relative to a trigger element. It is commonly used for tooltips, menus, or supplementary information. The component is highly customizable, supports accessibility standards, and is optimized for performance and seamless integration across applications.

   - Dynamic repositioning based on viewport constraints.

2. **Customization**:
   - Customizable colors, sizes, and animations.
   - Dynamic theming and styling support.
   - Configurable arrow and overlay styles.

3. **Accessibility**:
   - ARIA attributes for screen reader compatibility.
   - Keyboard navigation and focus management.
   - Support for high-contrast modes and reduced motion.

4. **Trigger Options**:
   - Multiple trigger actions (e.g., click, hover, focus).
   - Custom trigger elements (e.g., buttons, icons).

5. **Dynamic Content**:
   - Supports dynamic content (e.g., text, buttons, forms).
   - Content sanitization for security.

6. **Interactivity**:
   - Interactive elements inside the popover (e.g., links, buttons).
   - Focus trapping for better keyboard navigation.

7. **Animation**:
   - Smooth animations for opening and closing (e.g., fade, slide).
   - Configurable animation duration.

8. **Localization**:
   - Supports internationalization with translated content.
   - RTL (right-to-left) language support.

9. **Security**:
   - Sanitizes dynamic content to prevent XSS attacks.
   - Secure handling of user-generated content.

10. **Performance**:
    - Optimized for minimal re-renders and smooth animations.
    - Lazy loading for content.
