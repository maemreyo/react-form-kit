# Badge Component Design Specification

## Overview

The `Badge` component is a compact visual element used to highlight statuses, notifications, or counts in a user interface. It is commonly used to draw attention to new items, updates, or important information. The component is highly customizable, supports accessibility standards, and is optimized for performance and seamless integration across applications.
