# LoadingSpinner Component Design Specification

## Overview

The LoadingSpinner component is a visual indicator used to show that a process or task is in progress. It is commonly used in user interfaces to provide feedback during data fetching, form submissions, or other asynchronous operations. The LoadingSpinner component is highly customizable and supports various features to enhance usability, accessibility, and integration across different applications.

## Features

1. **Spinner Types**:
   - Supports multiple spinner styles (e.g., circular, dots, bars).

2. **Customization**:
   - Allows customization of colors, sizes, and animation speeds.
   - Supports dynamic theming and styling.

3. **Accessibility**:
   - Ensures compatibility with screen readers using ARIA attributes.
   - Provides descriptive labels for screen readers.

4. **Animation Control**:
   - Allows control over animation speed and direction.

5. **Dynamic State**:
   - Displays or hides the spinner based on the loading state.

6. **Integration**:
   - Seamlessly integrates with other UI components (e.g., buttons, modals).

7. **Performance**:
   - Optimized for smooth animations and minimal re-renders.

8. **Localization**:
   - Supports internationalization by accepting translated labels for screen readers.

9. **Security**:
   - Sanitizes any dynamic content to prevent XSS attacks.
